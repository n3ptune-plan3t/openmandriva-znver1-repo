%description
PowerTOP tool is a program that collects the various pieces of
information from a system and presents an overview of how well a
laptop is doing in terms of power savings. In addition, PowerTOP will

the biggest offenders in slurping up battery time. PowerTOP will
update it's display frequently so that the impact of any changes can
be seen directly.
